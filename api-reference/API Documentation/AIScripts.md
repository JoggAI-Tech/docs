## Introduction

Using the JoggAI API, you can generate AI scripts effortlessly. Simply provide the product information or the `product_id` generated in the [Upload URL to create product](https://docs.jogg.ai/api-reference/URL-to-Video/UploadURL), and you can create several different styles of product introduction scripts.

## Quick Start

### Generate Scripts from product

Provide the product information or the `product_id` generated at the "Upload URL to Create Product" endpoint, and you can create several different styles of product introduction scripts.
If you do not provide the `product_id`, then the product's `name` and `description` are required.

Please refer to the [AI Scripts](https://docs.jogg.ai/api-reference/AI-Scripts/AI-Scripts) for more details.
