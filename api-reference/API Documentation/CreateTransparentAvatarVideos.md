This document will guide you on how to create a digital avatar video with a transparent background using the [Jogg.ai](http://Jogg.ai) API. This type of video is ideal for post-production compositing or for overlaying the digital avatar on other visual content such as web pages or apps.

### **Core Concepts: Alpha Channel & File Formats**

When you request a transparent background video, we add an **Alpha Channel** to the video file. This channel stores transparency information, making all areas of the video completely transparent except for the digital avatar itself.

- **Use Cases:**
  - Seamlessly overlaying the digital avatar onto another video clip in video editing software (e.g., Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro).
  - Placing the digital avatar video on a top layer in web development to interact with the content below.
- **File Format:** The standard MP4 format does not typically support an Alpha channel for transparency. Therefore, transparent background videos will be provided in `.webm` or `.mov` format. Please ensure your player or editing tool supports these formats.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Like all video creation tasks, this process is asynchronous.

### Create Talking Avatar Video

Use the Create Talking Avatar Video API to control the output format by selecting the desired video specification with the `screen_style` parameter. This parameter controls the background style, allowing you to choose between videos with a background, green screen videos, or videos with a transparent background.

> Please note: If you need to output a **WebM** video with a transparent channel, please set the `caption` to false; otherwise, the WebM video cannot be generated.

Please refer to the [Create Talking Avatar Videos](https://docs.jogg.ai/api-reference/Create-Avatar-Videos/CreateAvatarVideo) for more details and refer to the next section for obtaining the avatar_id and voice_id.
