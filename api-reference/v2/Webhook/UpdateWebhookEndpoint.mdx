Update an existing webhook endpoint configuration, including URL, status, and subscribed events.

## Use Cases

- Modify webhook receiver URL
- Update subscribed event types
- Enable or disable webhook
- Adjust event notification scope

## Status Management

<Tip>
Set `status` to `disabled` to temporarily stop receiving events without deleting the endpoint configuration.

After updating the webhook endpoint, the new configuration takes effect immediately. Ensure the new URL is ready to receive requests.
