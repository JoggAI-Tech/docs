title: "Delete Webhook Endpoint"
openapi: "DELETE /v2/endpoint/{endpoint_id}"
---

Remove a webhook endpoint from your account.

This action cannot be undone and the endpoint will stop receiving events immediately.

## Use Cases

- Remove webhooks that are no longer needed
- Clean up inactive endpoints
- Stop event notifications

## Important Notes

<Warning>
Deleting a webhook endpoint cannot be reversed. All associated event subscriptions will be removed.
</Warning>

<Info>
If you only need to temporarily stop receiving events, we recommend using [Update Webhook Endpoint](/api-reference/v2/Webhook/UpdateWebhookEndpoint) to set the status to `disabled` instead of deleting the endpoint.
