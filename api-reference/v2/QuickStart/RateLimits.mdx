## Overview

Rate limits ensure fair usage and service quality for all users. Limits are applied per API key and vary by subscription plan.

<Info>
Rate limits reset every 60 seconds.

## Current Rate Limits

| Limit Type | Free Plan | Pro Plan | Enterprise |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Requests/minute** | 20 | 60 | 300 |
| **Burst requests** | 30 | 100 | 500 |
| **Concurrent videos** | 2 | 10 | 50 |
| **Webhooks/minute** | 10 | 30 | 100 |

<Note>
Enterprise plans can request custom rate limits. Contact [sales@jogg.ai](mailto:sales@jogg.ai).
</Note>

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes rate limit information:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests per minute |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when limit resets |
| `X-RateLimit-Type` | Type of limit applied |

---

## Rate Limit Exceeded

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive HTTP status `429`:

```json
{
  "code": 10401,
  "msg": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later.",
  "data": {
    "retryAfter": 30,
    "limit": 60,
    "current": 61
  }
}
```

## Handling Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Exponential Backoff">
    When rate limited, wait progressively longer before retrying:
    - 1st retry: wait 2 seconds
    - 2nd retry: wait 4 seconds
    - 3rd retry: wait 8 seconds
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Usage">
    Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header before making requests.
    If below threshold, slow down request rate.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Request Queuing">
    Queue requests and process them at a controlled rate to avoid hitting limits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  <Card title="Use Webhooks" icon="webhook">
    Use webhooks instead of polling for status updates
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Batch Requests" icon="layer-group">

## Endpoint-Specific Limits

Some endpoints have additional limits:

| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `/product` | 30 requests | Per minute |
| `/videos` | 10 concurrent | At any time |
| `/ai-scripts` | 20 requests | Per minute |
| `/upload` | 5 GB | Per day |

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hitting Limits Unexpectedly">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Multiple systems using same API key
    - Polling instead of webhooks
    - No caching implemented
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Use separate API keys per system
    - Implement webhooks for async operations
    - Cache frequently accessed data
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rate Limits Not Resetting">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Misunderstanding reset window
    - Time zone confusion
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check `X-RateLimit-Reset` header (Unix timestamp in UTC)
    - Implement proper time handling
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
